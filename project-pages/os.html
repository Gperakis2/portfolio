         <div class="body-text">Tinyos-3 files: The files that contain the code of the current version of tinyos-3 and the ones that need to be extended. The files are categorized into executable files, simulator files, application files, system files, and auxiliary files.</div>

It consists of cores, interrupts, barrier, inter-core interrupt, programmable interrupt controller (PIC), clock, and universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART).</div>
         <div class="body-text">Priority scheduler: The first part of the assignment was to implement a priority scheduler based on the multilevel feedback queues algorithm. The algorithm uses an array of queues, one for each priority level. Each thread has a priority field, which determines the queue it belongs to. The priority is adjusted according to the thread’s behavior and the first element of the highest priority non-empty queue is selected as the next thread.</div>
         <div class="body-text">Processes: The second part was to convert tinyos-3 processes to multithreaded ones. </div>
         <div class="body-text">The third part was to implement two process communication mechanisms, pipes and sockets.</div>
         <div class="body-text">The final part was to implement a user program that prints information about the system to standard output.</div>
